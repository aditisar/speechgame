# Speech Games

This is a final project for Physical Computing Studio (48-390) at CMU in Spring 2015. It is a game intended for ESL students to practice English vocabulary. 

The game requires custom built buzzers (connected via serial ports) to be played. 

More extensive documentation and process work can be found [here](http://physcomp.m4r5.io/).
